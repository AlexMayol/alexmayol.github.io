        <p>When I first saw your tweet looking for a new developer to join Tailwind's development, I thought 
            "Wow, that's my dream job. It's a shame I don't have enough experience or knowledge to contribute as much as a senior developer could, but I'd still love to work with Adam and Steve, that'd bring me SO much experience and joy".
            Anyway, here's my application because people say you have to follow your dreams and I'd be a fool to miss this amazing opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>Let my first tell you my story with Tailwind:</p>
        <p>The first time I heard about it and visited the site, I definitely didn't like the way it works, so I decided to write <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/AlexMayol/remedy" target="_blank">my own CSS framework to remedy all the problems I found</a> on my daily layout work.</p>
        <p>I then found myself doing the exact same thing Tailwind does, so I decided to give it a try and I absolutely fell in love with it. I know this is the general reaction of people, as you often tweet, but did it change the way I build websites...</p>
        <p>Ever since then, I've built ALL of my work proyects with it, no exception. Here's the list in case you are interested: </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4">
            <li><a class="underline" href="https://transferencia24.com/" target="_blank">Transferencia24</a>, an ecommerce where people can buy our service to interact with the Spanish National Department of Traffic and easy do various administrative managements. My biggest proyect so far. I'm really proud of it.</li>
            <li><a class="underline" href="https://worldcars.es/">Worldcars</a>, a car dealership website where we list all the stock so people can appoint a visit and try them. I first used my CSS framework I mentioned before, but once I figured the correct PostCSS config for my workflow, I rewrote the whole site with Tailwind.</li>
            <li><a class="underline" href="https://movehability.com/" target="_blank">Movehability</a>, online personal trainer website. I had all the needed configs from the other projects so it was Tailwind from the very beginning.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because the frontend ecosystem has been evolving rapidly in the last years, I'm really enjoying working on sites using flexbox or Grid to build the layout, and writting Vue, which I find is the best fit for me.
             I'm really excited about the increasingly global coverage of these new features and how it will impact bundle sizes and performance overall.
             Performance monitoring and optimization in the frontend is my favourite part, and I graduated with a thesis on <a class="underline" href="http://www.cc.uah.es/Atica/Atica2016/html/publicacion.html" target="_blank">web accessibility and testing tools</a>, so I've always kept in mind the foundation for a great website is a good markup.
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm currently working as a full-stack developer (VueJS, PHP) in Spain, where I live, but ever since I started learning web dev (during college), I've loved frontend and it has been my main focus.
           I've recently have gotten a Working Holiday Visa for Canada, so I'm planning on moving there as soon as the whole COVID situation allows it. I know you are based on Canada as well, so that's pretty cool.     
        </p>


        <p>As for the future, my personal bet is VueJS (OK, Svelte too ðŸ™„) and, of course, Tailwind. I've introduced and teached it to all my coworkers and they all love it now and think, like me, that Atomic CSS is the way to go.</p>
